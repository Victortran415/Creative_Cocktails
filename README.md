# Group Project - SQL Injection

In this project our team created a cocktail web application that references several different server-side and in-browser API's.

## Motivation

To create a cocktail for a dinner party or some sort of event. This app targets future bartenders or those looking to polish up their mixology skills. Our site can be an educational and entertaining resource.

	Every good bartender needs to both make a drink, and entertain their guests. Coupling together a Joke API and a Cocktail Recipe API allows our userbase to better learn and understand the ins and outs of bartending in general. One must both make an excellent drink and employ showmanship to impress their guest. Thatâ€™s what our app does. 

## Tech/Framework Used:

Built with:
-Vanilla Javascript 

-MaterializeCSS

Our project stands out because no one else has designed an application exactly like this. We recognized the need for a cocktail recipe API and recognized many aspiring hosts and bartenders need a way of entertaining their guests.

### **DO NOT OVERWRITE EACH OTHER'S CODE -- communicate on what we're doing.**


## Key Communication

- Communicate on what we're working on

- Let's reduce merge conflicts:

    -Touch base on what we're actively working on

    -if we're working on the same part of the project at the same time, let's let
    each other know on slack.
